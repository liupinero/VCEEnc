**[日本語版はこちら＞＞](./Readme.ja.md)**  

This software is meant to investigate performance and image quality of HW encoder (VCE) of AMD.
There are 2 types of software developed, one is command line version that runs independently, and the nother is a output plug-in of [Aviutl](http://spring-fragrance.mints.ne.jp/aviutl/).

VCEEncC.exe … Command line version supporting transcoding.  
VCEEnc.auo … Output plugin for [Aviutl](http://spring-fragrance.mints.ne.jp/aviutl/).

* RX 6400 and RX 6500 XT not supported, due to lack of HW Encoder on these cards! (Shame on you AMD)

## Auto GPU selection in multi GPU envinronment
VCEEncC will automatically select a GPU depending on the options used,
when there are multiple GPUs available which support VCE/VCN.
--device option can be used to specify on which GPU to run manually. 

1. Select GPU which supports...  
  Items below will be checked whether the GPU supports it or not  
  - Codec, Profile, Level
  - Additionally, below items will be checked if specified
    - 10bit depth encoding
    - HW decode
  
2. Prefer GPU which supports...  
  - B frame support
  
3. If there are multiple GPUs which suports all the items checked in 1. and 2., GPU below will be prefered.  
  - GPU which has low Video Engine(VE) utilization
  - GPU which has low GPU core utilization
  
  The purpose of selecting GPU with lower VE/GPU ulitization is to assign tasks to mulitple GPUs
  and improve the throughput of the tasks.  
  
  Please note that VE and GPU ulitization are check at the initialization pahse of the app,
  and there are delays in values taken. Therefore, it is likely that the multiple tasks started at the same time
  to run on the same GPU, and divided into multiple GPUs, even if the options are supported in every GPUs.
